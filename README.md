# MBAN-Practice
Glaucoma.ipynb was a project I worked on during my Masters.
This project uses 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans and clinical data to detect glaucoma.  
It combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with tabular data features to try to improve classification accuracy.
This was run on Google Colab since the size of the data and the work done on it meant a lot of extra computing power was needed.
