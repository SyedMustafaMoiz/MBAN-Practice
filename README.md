Glaucoma.ipynb was a project I worked on during my Masters.
This project uses 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans and clinical data to detect glaucoma.  
It combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with tabular data features to try to improve classification accuracy.
For this project I contacted several universities to get 3D OCT scans, and I discussed possible features of this model with my optometrist.
The medical recommendations depending on severity are a template based on my understanding of glaucoma treatment.
This was run on Google Colab since the size of the data and the work done on it meant a lot of extra computing power was needed.
